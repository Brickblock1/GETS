# GETS
**German Extrazoom Trainset for OTTD**

**What is this?**

GETS is a newgrf for the Open Source Transport Simulation OpenTTD.
It is an Extrazoom-grf, which contains 4x-Zoom sprites. Although it is technically 32bpp, it aims to stay close to the original colours.
Trains are carefully modelled after their real-life models using Magica Voxel and Timberwolfs GoRender.
Compatible with OpenTTD 13.0 and after, the grf makes use of the new variants feature, displaying most trains in historic and up-to-date liveries 
of either German State or Privately owned railway companies.

The trains in this grf are longer than standard and do not contain a Company-Colour Option. Multiple-Units are fixed length and try to resemble those consists found on german rails. 

**How to build from source?**

The pre-compiled grf is only available via OpenTTD's online content downloader at the moment.
This grf uses StarRaids NML-Patcher to build. To build from source, you'll need to have python and up-do-date nml installed. If you have this, just run pybuild.bat.
